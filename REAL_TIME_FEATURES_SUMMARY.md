## 🔧 How to Use These Features

### Backend Integration

1. **Initialize Services**:
```javascript
const RealTimePerformanceDashboard = require('./services/realTimePerformanceDashboard');
const AdvancedLocationTracking = require('./services/advancedLocationTracking');

const performanceDashboard = new RealTimePerformanceDashboard(socketService);
const locationTracking = new AdvancedLocationTracking(socketService);
```

2. **Access Metrics**:
```javascript
// Get current performance metrics
const metrics = performanceDashboard.getMetrics();

// Get historical data
const historicalData = performanceDashboard.getHistoricalData('system', 100);

// Get alerts
const alerts = performanceDashboard.getAlerts();
```

3. **Manage Geofences**:
```javascript
// Create a new geofence
const geofence = await locationTracking.createGeofence({
  name: 'Downtown Pickup Zone',
  type: 'pickup',
  center: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },
  radius: 500,
  rules: {
    entered: [{ action: 'notify', message: 'Welcome to pickup zone!' }]
  }
});

// Get active geofences
const activeGeofences = locationTracking.getActiveGeofences();
```

### Frontend Integration

1. **Initialize Enhanced Real-Time Manager**:
```javascript
import EnhancedRealTimeManager from './utils/enhancedRealTimeManager';

const realTimeManager = new EnhancedRealTimeManager();
await realTimeManager.connect();
```

2. **Listen for Events**:
```javascript
// Performance updates
realTimeManager.on('performance:updated', (metrics) => {
  console.log('System performance:', metrics);
});

// Geofence events
realTimeManager.on('geofence:entered', (event) => {
  console.log('Entered geofence:', event.metadata.geofenceName);
});

// Communication events
realTimeManager.on('call:incoming', (call) => {
  console.log('Incoming call from:', call.callerId);
});

realTimeManager.on('message:received', (message) => {
  console.log('New message:', message);
});
```

3. **Send Real-Time Updates**:
```javascript
// Update location
realTimeManager.updateLocation(latitude, longitude);

// Update availability
realTimeManager.updateAvailability(true);

// Send message
realTimeManager.sendMessage(rideId, 'I am on my way!');

// Start typing indicator
realTimeManager.startTyping(rideId);
```
