This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

  - Make sure USB debugging is enabled.
  - Try running `adb devices` in your terminal to see if your device is listed.
    - If not, install [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and add to your PATH.
  - Accept any permission dialogs on your phone.
  - Try a different USB cable or port.

# Driver App

## Authentication Update

- **Login/Register is now via mobile number and OTP only.**
- Enter your mobile number and tap 'Send OTP'.
- Use the fake OTP: **123456** (always works for testing).
- If it's a new number, you will be prompted to enter your name and car info to complete registration.
- No email or password is required. Email-based login and verification are disabled.

## How to Test
1. Start the backend and frontend as usual.
2. On the login screen, enter a mobile number (any valid format).
3. Tap 'Send OTP'.
4. Enter **123456** as the OTP.
5. If prompted, fill in your name and car info.
6. You will be logged in as a driver.
